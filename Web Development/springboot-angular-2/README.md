This project was done for the subject Design Based in Components and Services with Elias Abril.

It implements a User management system (REST Api) using Angular for the frontend and Spring boot for the backend. Json Objects are used as DTOs.

The system will allow to add new Users, edit their info, delete them, search by id, list enabled/disabled users and enable/disable checked users. More info in README.pdf
