This team project was done for the subject Web Systems and Services.

The goal was designing and implementing a Web that would allow a company to sell trips to customers and let companies post their trips in the web. Login, and Crud methods were implemented.

We started by doing the analysis and design with Domain Models, DB Models, Web Flowcharts... (in the pdf).

Actual programming was done with Html, CSS and JS for the front end and Java Servlets for the backend (Maven was used to manage dependencies and Derby JDBC for the DB). Apache Tomcat was used to host the server.
