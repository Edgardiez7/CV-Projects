This project was done for the subject Design Based in Components and Services with Elias Abril.

THis project has 4 Docker containers (LoginRest, UserManagementRest, FrontEnd and Database) all contained in 1 docker-compose.

These microservices implement both a Login and a User management system (REST Api) using Angular for the frontend and Spring boot for the backend. Json Objects are used as DTOs.

The system will allow to login with a existing User, add new Users, edit their info, delete them, search by id, list enabled/disabled users and enable/disable checked users. More info in README.pdf
